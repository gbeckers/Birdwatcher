Birdwatcher
===========

Birdwatcher is a Python computer vision library for the analysis of animal
behavior.

It is developed by Gabriel Beckers, Sita ter Haar and Carien Mol, at
Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University.

It is being used in our lab but not stable enough yet for general use. More
info will be provided when a first release is appropriate.

Code can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/gbeckers/Birdwatcher
