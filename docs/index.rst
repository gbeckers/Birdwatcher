Birdwatcher
===========

|Repo Status| |Github CI Status| |Appveyor Status| |Docs Status|

Birdwatcher is a Python computer vision library for the measurement and
analysis of animal behavior.

The purpose of this library is to provide base functionality for analysing
animal behavior in a Python scientific computing environment. It
is not intended as a final product to analyse specific behaviors of
specific animals, but rather to facilitate working efficiently with
video data in a scientific Python environment and to apply computer vision
algorithms. It can function as a base package for more specific analysis
code or specialized measurement tools.

Despite its name, Birdwatcher is not only for birds. We also successfully
analyze dog behavior, and it could be used on anything that moves. It is
being used in our lab but not stable enough yet for general use. More info
will be provided when a first release is appropriate.

Code can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/gbeckers/Birdwatcher .

An incipient documentation can be found at https://birdwatcher.readthedocs.io .

It is developed by Gabriel Beckers and Carien Mol, at Experimental Psychology,
Utrecht University.
