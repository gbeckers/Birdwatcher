Birdwatcher
===========

Birdwatcher is a Python computer vision library for the measurement and
analysis of animal behavior.

It is developed by Gabriel Beckers and Carien Mol, at Experimental
Psychology, Utrecht University.

The purpose of this library is to provide low-level functionality for analysing
videos animal behavior in a Python scientific computing environment.


Despite its name, Birdwatcher is not only for bird behavior. We also
successfully analyze dog behavior, and it could be used on anything that moves.
It is being used in our lab but not stable enough yet for general use. More
info will be provided when a first release is appropriate.

Code can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/gbeckers/Birdwatcher
