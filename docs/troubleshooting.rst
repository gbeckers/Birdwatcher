Troubleshooting

Permision Error
---------------
Birdwatcher may require write access to darr files on disk. In some operating
systems (e.g. Windows) this may lead to a PermissionError [WinError 32] when
other programs are automatically locking it for their own access. In
practice, this may become problematic for example when files are at the same
time synchronized by Dropbox. It is best not to work with writeable arrays in
folders that are synchronized and locked by Dropbox or other programs.
