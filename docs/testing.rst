Testing
=======

Most functionality has test functions, and we are working on making the test
suite as complete as possible.

To run the test suite:

.. code:: python

    >>> import birdwatcher as bw
    >>> bw.test()
    .................................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 33 tests in 12.788s

    OK
